== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby-based client for JasperServer. Allows for requesting and fetching reports 
from a networked JasperServer over SOAP.

== SYNOPSIS:

  # Create a new client instance for the JasperServer running at 
  # http://example.com/jasperserver
  client = JasperServer::Client.new("http://example.com/jasperserver/services/repository",
                                    "jasperadmin", "secret!")
                                    
  # Create a request for a report. The first parameter is the full path of the 
  # report unit, the second is the desired output format, and the last is an 
  # optional hash of parameters to be fed into the report.
  request = JasperServer::Request.new("/example/my-report", "PDF", {'fruit' => 'apple'})
  
  # Send the report request to the server and return the output data.
  pdf_data = client.request_report(request)
  
  # Write the report data to a file (instead you could send the data to the user's
  # browser if you're doing this in, for example, a Rails controller action).
  File.open('/tmp/report.pdf', 'w') do |f|
    f.puts(pdf_data)
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* A Ruby interpreter.
* The soap4r gem, version 1.5.8 or greater. (This should be automatically
  installed as a dependency; otherwise run `gem install soap4r`.)
* A running JasperServer instance, obviously. The client has been tested
  with versions 2.0 through to 3.0 of JasperServer.

== INSTALL:

* Via RubyGems: `gem install jasperserver-client`
